    "Here we are going to build a simple RNN model with an embedding layer. To do this, first we have to vectorize each review. It can be done with a *TextVectorization* layer which creates a vocabulary from a text corpus and encode every review as a list of indices for each word in the vocabulary. The length of each sequence is the same and we can specify it manually. Then every shorter sequence is just padded with zeros which can be masked during training. We have to also specify the size of the vocabulary. "

    "Here we can see the same problem as before. Our model is highly overfitting. For couple of steps the validation loss is decreasing but then it starts to increase. We use a early stopping and a model checkpoint callbacks to save the best model. We can either have a model which will perform well on the majority class and poor on the other or it will perform similar on all of them but still not really good. The model which was just trained is the overall best model in terms of validation loss where the minority classes have more correct predictions then we got with the previous models. The overfitting here is not that severe -> roughly *81%* accuracy on the train set and *74%* on the validation set. Now we can also try to train the other model for longer and compare predictions."
